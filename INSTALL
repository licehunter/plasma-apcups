INSTALLING APCUPS PLASMOID FROM SOURCES
=======================================

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading to a new build of ApcUps, you should
========== uninstall the old one first. Follow the uninstallation instructions
           at the end of this document before continuing.

ApcUps consist of these two components:

plasma-dataengine-apcups:
    Plasma data engine that talks to apcupsd daemons. This also provides
    a D-BUS service (eu.navlost.apcupsmon)
plasmoid-apcups:
    Plasmoid that shows some basic information about an UPS.

To build, make sure you have the prerequisites.

- Linux kernel >= 2.6
- CMake >= 2.6
- GCC and make
- Qt >= 4.5 development files and headers
- KDE >= 4.3 development files and headers

openSUSE 11.2 or later users can run this to get the required packages:
  zypper install cmake libqt4-devel libkde4-devel

Once you have the required libraries, you can build and install with:
  cd <apcups_dir>
  ./install.sh

The script will escalate your privileges to root (using "sudo") to complete the
installation. If that makes you nervous, you can do each step manually. Just
take a look at what "install.sh" does and do the same thing at the console.    

IMPORTANT: The last step of the installation is to restart your Plasma desktop
session. You will very likely get an error if you try to use the widget before
doing this. To restart Plasma, you can log out and then log back in. Or at the
console, type:
  kquitapp plasma-desktop
  plasma-desktop 

INSTALLING APCUPS FROM PACKAGES
===============================

Binary installation packages for certain Linux distributions are available 
via the openSUSE Build Service (build.opensuse.org). These can be installed
through your distro's native package manager. You can also add our
repositories to be notified about future upgrades. Visit 
http://navlost.eu/devel/apcups for details.

IMPORTANT: After installing or upgrading packages, you must restart your
Plasma desktop session. You will very likely get an error if you try to use
the widget before doing this. To restart Plasma, you can log out and then log
back in. Or at the console, type:
  kquitapp plasma-desktop
  plasma-desktop 

Note that these packages are not "official" packages maintained by the distro
developers. If your distro provides its own packages, you should use those
instead unless you want the absolute latest code.

You can also build the distro packages yourself if you have an account at the
openSUSE Build Service (OBS). To do this, first run the "./obs-staging.sh"
script from the top-level project directory. This will prepare a tarball of
the source code and also generate the meta-package files, all of which are
placed in a subdirectory called "staging". Simply upload the contents of
this directory to OBS or use the command line "osc" tool to build packages
locally. Instructions for OBS are available at http://build.opensuse.org. 

UNINSTALLING APCUPS
===================

To remove ApcUps or before upgrading, follow these steps:

1) Remove all ApcUps widgets from desktops and panels.

2) a) If you installed directly from sources, run these commands as root:
        cd <apcups_dir>/build
        make uninstall
   b) If you installed from a package, remove it via your package manager.
